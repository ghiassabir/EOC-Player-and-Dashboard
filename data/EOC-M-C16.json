    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The problem states that the point $(-a, a)$ is on the line $y = ax + 12$. This means we can substitute $x = -a$ and $y = a$ into the equation and it will be a true statement. \n$a = a(-a) + 12$ \n$a = -a^2 + 12$ \nThis is a quadratic equation. To solve it, we should move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. \n$a^2 + a - 12 = 0$ \nNow we can factor the quadratic expression. We need two numbers that multiply to -12 and add to +1. These numbers are +4 and -3. \n$(a+4)(a-3) = 0$ \nThis gives two possible solutions for $a$: $a = -4$ or $a = 3$. The problem specifies that $a > 0$, so we must choose the positive solution. \nTherefore, $a=3$.",
