    "explanation_original": "The square of the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $(x + y)^2$. The product of $x$ and $y$ is $xy$. The question asks for the difference: $(x + y)^2 - xy$",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "This question requires translating verbal phrases into algebraic expressions. Let's break it down:<br><br>1. \"The sum of x and y\" is written as $(x + y).<br><br>2. \"The square of the sum of x and y\" means we take the entire sum and square it: $(x + y)^2.<br><br>3. \"The product of x and y\" is written as $xy$.<br><br>4. \"decreased by\" means subtraction.<br><br>So, we subtract the product from the square of the sum: $(x + y)^2 - xy$. This matches option D.",
    "feedback_a": "This option represents the sum of the squares of $x$ and $y$, decreased by their product. The question asks for the square of their sum, which is different.",
    "feedback_b": "This option squares each variable individually before multiplying them, which does not represent the \"square of the sum\". The phrase \"square of the sum\" means you must add first, then square.",
