Pipe A's rate is $\\frac{1}{4}$ tank per hour. Pipe B's rate is $\\frac{1}{6}$ tank per hour. 2. Their combined rate is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6}$. To add these, find a common denominator, which is 12: $\\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{5}{12}$. So, together they fill $\\frac{5}{12}$ of the tank per hour. 3. To find the total time in hours to fill 1 tank, we can use the formula Work = Rate x Time. $1 = (\\frac{5}{12}) \\times t$. So, $t = \\frac{12}{5}$ hours. 4. The question asks for the value of $m$ in minutes. We must convert the time from hours to minutes. 5. $m = \\frac{12}{5} \\text{ hours} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 12 \\times \\frac{60}{5} = 12 \\times 12 = 144$ minutes.",

Let $t$ be the time in seconds after Jessica starts running. 1. Yoona's speed is 1 yd/s. Jessica's speed is 4 times as fast, so it is 4 yd/s. 2. Yoona has a 30-yard head start. Her distance from the start after time $t$ is $D_Y = 30 + 1t$. 3. Jessica starts from 0. Her distance from the start after time $t$ is $D_J = 4t$. 4. They meet when their distances are equal. Set $D_Y = D_J$: $30 + t = 4t$. 5. Solve for the time $t$. Subtract $t$ from both sides: $30 = 3t$. So, $t = 10$ seconds. 6. The question asks how many yards Jessica must run.

    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "Let $s$ be the side length of the original square patio. The original area is $s^2$. 1. The new, renovated patio is a rectangle. Its new length is $s+4$. Its new width is $s-5$. 2. The area of this new rectangular patio is given as 90. The area is length times width, so $(s+4)(s-5) = 90$. 3. Expand the left side using FOIL: $s^2 - 5s + 4s - 20 = 90$. 4. Simplify to get a quadratic equation: $s^2 - s - 20 = 90$. 5. Set the equation to zero by subtracting 90 from both sides: $s^2 - s - 110 = 0$. 6. Factor the quadratic. We need two numbers that multiply to -110 and add to -1. These numbers are -11 and +10. So, $(s-11)(s+10) = 0$. 7. The possible solutions for $s$ are $s=11$ or $s=-10$. Since side length must be positive, $s=11$ feet. 8. The question asks for the original area of the patio, which was $s^2$. 9. Original area = $11^2 = 121$ square feet.",

    "explanation_original": "This problem follows the format of a standard $W = rt$ word problem, where $W$ is the amount of work done, $r$ is the overall rate at which work is being done, and $t$ is the time spent. If Terry can finish the parking lot in $x$ days by himself, then Andy can finish it in $2x$ days by himself. This means that Terry paves $\\frac{1}{x}$ of the parking lot each day and Andy paves $\\frac{1}{2x}$ of the parking lot each day. Working together, they pave $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{2x}$ of the parking lot each day. This is the overall rate $r$. The number $\\frac{2}{3}$ is the remaining fraction of the parking lot that has yet to be paved. This is $W$. So the number 9 must be $t$. And given what we have for $W$ and $r$, $t$ must be the number of days it will take Terry and Andy to pave the remainder of the parking lot working together.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "Let's break down the equation $9(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{2x}) = \\frac{2}{3}$ based on the Work = Rate × Time formula. - **Work (W):** Terry finished $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the job, so the remaining work is $1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$. This is the right side of the equation. So, $W = \\frac{2}{3}$. - **Rate (r):** If Terry takes $x$ days, his rate is $\\frac{1}{x}$ jobs per day. Since Terry works twice as fast as Andy, Andy takes twice as long, or $2x$ days. Andy's rate is $\\frac{1}{2x}$ jobs per day. Their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: $r = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{2x}$. This is the expression inside the parentheses. - **Time (t):** The formula is $W = r \\times t$. In the given equation, the Rate is multiplied by 9 to equal the Work. So, 9 must represent the time, $t$. Therefore, 9 is the time (in days) it takes for them, working together, to complete the remaining work ($\\frac{2}{3}$ of the lot).",
