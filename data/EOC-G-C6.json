    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The phrase 'Fowlie argues' is a non-essential interruption that indicates the source of the quote. Such phrases should be enclosed in commas. The question provides the opening comma after 'was', so the correct option must provide the phrase and the closing comma.",
    "feedback_a": "This is the correct answer. The interrupting phrase is followed by a comma to correctly set it off.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is missing the closing comma.",
    "feedback_c": "A dash is incorrect punctuation in this context.",
    "feedback_d": "The comma between 'Fowlie' and 'argues' is incorrect."

    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The main clause is 'it is possible that the unit was formed even earlier...'. The 'when' clause that follows is non-essential, providing extra detail, so it should be preceded by a comma. Within that clause, 'who were already experienced elephant-hunters' is an essential clause specifying which women formed the troupe. Essential 'who' clauses are not set off by commas.",
    "feedback_a": "This option incorrectly places commas around the 'who' clause, treating it as non-essential when it is essential to specify which women are being discussed.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is missing the comma before 'when' and incorrectly punctuates the essential 'who' clause.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. A comma correctly separates the non-essential 'when' clause, and the essential 'who' clause is correctly not set off by commas.",
    "feedback_d": "This option is missing the necessary comma before 'when'."
