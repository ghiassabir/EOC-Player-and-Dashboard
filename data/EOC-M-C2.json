    "explanation_original": "The percent change is the new minus the old over the old times 100. Notice that the P's cancel out. $\\frac{(P(1+\\frac{r}{100})^5 - P)}{P} \\times 100 = [(1+\\frac{r}{100})^5 - 1] \\times 100$",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The formula for percent increase is: $\\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\times 100$. The 'Old Value' is the initial population, $P$. The 'New Value' is the population after five years, given by the expression $P(1 + \\frac{r}{100})^5$. Substitute these into the formula: $\\frac{P(1 + \\frac{r}{100})^5 - P}{P} \\times 100$. We can factor out $P$ from the numerator: $\\frac{P \\left[ (1 + \\frac{r}{100})^5 - 1 \\right]}{P} \\times 100$. The $P$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving: $\\left[ (1 + \\frac{r}{100})^5 - 1 \\right] \\times 100$.",

    "feedback_b": "This expression is incorrect. It divides by the new population size instead of the original population size when calculating the percent change.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. It represents $(\\frac{\\text{New}}{\\text{Old}} - 1) \\times 100$, which is the correct formula for percent increase after the P's cancel.",
    "feedback_d": "This expression multiplies the growth factor by 100, which does not correctly calculate the percent increase. It misses subtracting the original amount (represented by '1' after P cancels).",

Which of the following expressions gives the percent increase in the leopard population over these five years?"
