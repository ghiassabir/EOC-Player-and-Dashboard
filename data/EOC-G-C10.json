    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The sentence requires a subject and a verb for the second clause. 'It's' is a contraction for 'it is,' which provides the necessary subject ('it') and verb ('is'). 'Its' is a possessive pronoun, 'its'' is grammatically incorrect, and 'their' is a plural possessive pronoun that doesn't agree with the singular noun 'lemur'.",
    "feedback_a": "This is the possessive form, but the sentence needs a subject and verb ('it is').",
    "feedback_b": "This is the correct answer. 'It's' is the contraction for 'it is', which correctly completes the sentence.",
    "feedback_c": "The form 'its'' is not a valid English word.",
