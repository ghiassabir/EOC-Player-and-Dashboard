The plural pronoun 'them' refers to the plural noun that is the object of the verb 'created.' The researchers created the planets and then modeled what would happen to 'them' (the planets).\n\nWhy A, B, and D are wrong: 'Researchers' are the ones performing the action, not the object of the action. 'Models' were developed, but 'them' refers to the planets being subjected to the modeling. 'Types of suns' were a variable in the simulation, but the pronoun 'them' refers to the main thing being studied, which is the planets.",
