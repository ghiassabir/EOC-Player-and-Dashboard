[cite: 112] However, the last few decades have seen the emergence of a new ____ three-dimensional stone wall murals. [cite_start]One such mural was produced by Janna Morrison in 2005. [cite: 114] [cite_start]She combined the piecework of mosaic murals with traditional soapstone slab carving. [cite: 114]",

    "correct_answer": "style: colorful,",
    "explanation_original": "However, the last few decades have seen the emergence of a new style: colorful, three-dimensional stone wall murals.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The phrase 'colorful, three-dimensional stone wall murals' functions as a definition or specification of the 'new style' that precedes it. [cite_start]A colon is the appropriate punctuation to introduce a list, definition, or explanation that follows a complete sentence. [cite: 61] The clause 'However, the last few decades have seen the emergence of a new style' is an independent clause.",
    "feedback_a": "The comma usage in this option incorrectly separates the defining phrase from the noun it describes.",
    "feedback_b": "This is the correct choice. A colon is used effectively to introduce a phrase that specifies the 'new style'.",
    "feedback_c": "The combination of a comma and a dash is an incorrect and nonstandard way to punctuate this sentence.",
    "feedback_d": "A semicolon is incorrect because it is used to connect two independent clauses, and the phrase 'colorful, three-dimensional stone wall murals' is not an independent clause."

    [cite_start]"passage_content": "Researchers have long believed that camels originated in North America, a theory that was first proposed after a camel fossil was discovered in Canada's Yukon Territory in 1913. As paleontologists eventually discovered, these camels were much larger than their modern ____ long, massive limbs and long spines on their backs, creating an enormous hump. [cite: 115]",

    "explanation_original": "As paleontologists eventually discovered, these camels were much larger than their modern counterparts-they had long, massive limbs and long spines on their backs, creating an enormous hump.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "This sentence presents two closely related independent clauses. The first is 'these camels were much larger than their modern counterparts'. The second, 'they had long, massive limbs...', explains the first. [cite_start]A dash can be used to connect two independent clauses, particularly when the second one explains or elaborates on the first. [cite: 67, 68]",
    "feedback_a": "This option creates a comma splice by incorrectly joining two independent clauses with only a comma.",
    "feedback_b": "This is the correct choice. A dash effectively connects the two independent clauses, with the second clause providing a clear explanation for the first.",
    "feedback_c": "A semicolon should be followed by an independent clause. 'Having...' is a participial phrase, not an independent clause, making this option ungrammatical.",
    "feedback_d": "This option creates a run-on sentence by fusing two independent clauses together with no punctuation."
