    "explanation_original": "Let $s, m,$ and $l$ be the weights of small, medium, and large jars, respectively. Based on the information, we can create the following two equations: $16s = 2m+l$; $4s+m = l$. To get the weight of the large jar in terms of the weight of the small jar, we need to get rid of $m$, the weight of the medium jar. We could certainly use elimination, but here, we'll use substitution. Isolating $m$ in the second equation, $m = l - 4s$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $16s = 2(l-4s)+l \\implies 16s = 2l-8s+l \\implies 24s = 3l \\implies 8s=l$. Eight small jars are needed to match the weight of one large jar.",

Let $s$ represent the weight of a small jar, $m$ represent the weight of a medium jar, and $l$ represent the weight of a large jar.<br>From the first statement: \"Sixteen small jars weigh as much as two medium jars and one large jar.\" This translates to: $16s = 2m + l$ (Equation 1).<br>From the second statement: \"Four small jars and one medium jar have the same weight as one large jar.\" This translates to: $4s + m = l$ (Equation 2).<br>The question asks: \"How many small jars have the weight of one large jar?\" This means we need to find $k$ such that $ks = l$. Our goal is to express $l$ solely in terms of $s$. We can use substitution. Since both equations are equal to $l$, we can set them equal to each other: $16s = 2m + (4s+m)$. Combine like terms: $16s = 4s + 3m$. Subtract $4s$ from both sides: $12s = 3m$. Divide by $3$: $m = 4s$.

We need two numbers that multiply to $-10$ and add to $-3$. These numbers are $-5$ and $2$. So, the factored form is $(x-5)(x+2) = 0$.<br>Set each factor to zero to find the possible $x$-values:<br>$x - 5 = 0 \\implies x = 5$<br>$x + 2 = 0 \\implies x = -2$<br>Now, substitute these $x$-values back into $y = x+11$ to find the corresponding $y$-values:<br>If $x = 5$: $y = 5+11 = 16$. So, one solution is $(5,16)$.<br>If $x = -2$: $y = -2+11 = 9$. So, another solution is $(-2,9)$.<br>The possible values of $y$ are $9$ and $16$.",
