Let's use the values from Monday and Thursday to calculate the slope: $\\frac{616 - 584}{7.2 - 6.8} = 80$. At this point, we can tell the answer is probably going to be choice C, but let's find the y-intercept just to be sure. Currently, we have $c = 80s + b$. Plugging in $s = 7.2$ and $c = 616$ from Monday, we get $616 = 80(7.2) + b$, which gives $b = 616 - 80(7.2) = 40$. Therefore, $c(s) = 80s + 40$. An alternative solution is to test each of the answer choices by plugging in the values from the table. ... Only answer C gives the correct value of c for each of the given values of s.",
