Option C correctly uses this parallel '-ing' structure for all three items.",
    "feedback_a": "This option uses an inconsistent grammatical structure ('with sticky bolas they lasso it') and mixes semicolons and commas improperly.",

    "explanation_original": "...it featured a distinctive combination...that would characterize WertmÃ¼ller's future works.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "This sentence is set in the past (referring to a 1963 film). It describes something that, from that past perspective, was going to happen in the future ('future works'). To describe a future event from a past point of view, the conditional 'would' is used. 'Will' is used to describe a future event from the present perspective.",
    "feedback_a": "This is a plural, present tense verb.",
    "feedback_b": "'Will characterize' describes a future event from the present, but the sentence's main context is in the past.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. 'Would characterize' correctly describes a future action from a past perspective.",
    "feedback_d": "This phrasing is awkward and not the best fit for the sentence."
